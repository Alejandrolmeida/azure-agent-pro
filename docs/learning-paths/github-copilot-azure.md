## üéØ Optimized Prompts for Azure Tasks

### üìù Bicep Template Generation

**Prompt Template:**
```
Create a Bicep template for [AZURE_SERVICE] with the following requirements:
- Security: [SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS]
- Environment: [DEV/TEST/PROD]
- Compliance: [COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS]
- Cost optimization: [BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS]

Include:
- Parameter validation
- Resource naming conventions
- Output values
- Security best practices
- Comments explaining decisions

Use enterprise-grade patterns and follow Azure Well-Architected Framework principles.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Copilot Techniques

### 1. Context-Aware Development

**Before asking Copilot:**
1. Open relevant files in your workspace
2. Include resource naming conventions in comments
3. Add environment context (dev/test/prod)
4. Reference related Azure services

**Example:**
```bicep
// Context: Production environment
// Naming convention: company-env-location-service-purpose
// Related services: Key Vault, App Service, SQL Database
// Compliance: SOC 2, HIPAA

param storageAccountName string = 'contosoprodeuststorage'
```

### 2. Incremental Refinement

Start with basic prompts and refine:

**Initial:**
```
Create a storage account in Bicep
```

**Refined:**
```
Create a production-ready storage account Bicep template with:
- GPv2 with hot/cool tiers
- Private endpoints
- Lifecycle management
- Encryption with customer-managed keys
- Diagnostic logging
- RBAC assignments
```

### 3. Documentation-Driven Development

Include documentation requirements in prompts:
```
Generate a Bicep module with comprehensive documentation including:
- Parameter descriptions
- Usage examples
- Security considerations
- Cost implications
- Troubleshooting guide
```

## üìä Productivity Metrics

Track your Copilot productivity:

- **Lines of code generated**: Monitor daily/weekly output
